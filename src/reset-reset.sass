// "the-new-css-reset" resets so much stuff that checkboxes have no rectangle to click and select elements have no arrow in the dropdown
// We could style these ourselves, see here https://elad.medium.com/the-new-css-reset-53f41f13282e but for now just revert the reset
input,
textarea,
select
  all: revert
